### Manual Testing
The process of checking the functionality of an application as per the customer needs without taking any help of automation tools is known as manual testing. 
While performing the manual testing on any application, we do not need any specific knowledge of any testing tool, rather than have a proper understanding of the product so we can easily prepare the test document.

### Automation Testing
Automation testing is a process of converting any manual test cases into the test scripts with the help of automation tools, or any programming language is known as automation testing. 
With the help of automation testing, we can enhance the speed of our test execution because here, we do not require any human efforts. We need to write a test script and execute those scripts.

## Testing

### Unit Testing
Unit testing involves the testing of each unit or an individual component of the software application. 
It is the first level of functional testing. The aim behind unit testing is to validate unit components with its performance.

### Integration Testing
Integration testing is the second level of the software testing process comes after unit testing. 
In this testing, units or individual components of the software are tested in a group. 
The focus of the integration testing level is to expose defects at the time of interaction between integrated components or units.

### System Testing
System Testing includes testing of a fully integrated software system. Generally, a computer system is made with the integration of software (any software is only a single element of a computer system). 
The software is developed in units and then interfaced with other software and hardware to create a complete computer system. 
In other words, a computer system consists of a group of software to perform the various tasks, but only software cannot perform the task; for that software must be interfaced with compatible hardware. 
System testing is a series of different type of tests with the purpose to exercise and examine the full working of an integrated software computer system against requirements.

### Performance Testing
Checking the behavior of an application by applying some load is known as performance testing. 
Generally, this testing defines how quickly the server responds to the user's request.
While doing performance testing on the application, we will concentrate on the various factors like Response time, Load, and Stability of the application.

### Security Testing
Security testing is an integral part of software testing, which is used to discover the weaknesses, risks, or threats in the software application and also help us to stop the nasty attack from the outsiders and make sure the security of our software applications.
The primary objective of security testing is to find all the potential ambiguities and vulnerabilities of the application so that the software does not stop working. If we perform security testing, then it helps us to identify all the possible security threats and also help the programmer to fix those errors.

### Cross-Browser Testing / Cross-Platform Testing / Compability Testing
Checking the functionality of an application on different software, hardware platforms, network, and browsers is known as compatibility testing. 
Once the application is stable, we moved it to the production, it may be used or accessed by multiple users on the different platforms, and they may face some compatibility issues, to avoid these issues, we do one round of compatibility testing.
